Handwritten Digit Recognition USING NEURAL NETWORK( Back Propagation Algorithm

The main aim of this project was to design expert system for Handwritten Digit Recognition (HDR)  using Neural Network‚Äù. that can effectively recognize a particular digit of type format using the Artificial Neural Network approach. Neural computing Is comparatively new field, and design components are therefore less well specified than those of other architectures. Neural computers implement data parallelism. Neural computer are operated in way which is completely different from the operation of normal computers. Neural computer are trained (not Programmed) so that given a certain starting state (data input); they either classify the input data into one of the number of classes or cause the original data to evolve in such a way that a certain desirable property is optimized.
